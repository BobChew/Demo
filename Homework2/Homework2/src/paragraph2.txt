The value of carbon footprinting and labelling lies in identifying these sorts of savings, rather than informing
consumers or making companies look green. According to a report issued in 2009 by the Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, in England, ¡°the main benefits of
carbon labelling are likely to be incurred not via communication of emissions values to consumers, but
upstream via manufacturers looking for additional ways to reduce emissions.¡± It is not so much the label
itself that matters, in other words, but the process that must be gone through to create it. Walkers has
reduced the footprint of its crisps by 7% since the introduction of its first carbon labels. Indeed, to use the
Carbon Trust¡¯s label, companies must do more than just measure the footprint of a product: they must
commit themselves to reducing it.
